# Extending SQL functionality

## Architecture Overview
The entrypoint for sql functionality is found at:

sdk/burdock/query/sql/private/query.py

The general architecture starts off with a SQL query, dataset name, and budget received from the user as inputs. The sql module code can be found in service/modules/sql-module.
SQL parsing includes reading the user SQL into an AST, morphing the AST for DP related preprocessing. The preprocessed query is compiled back into a string and sent to the reader. We have a local CSV reader and support a few odbc based readers. After the result of the preprocessed query is received, a final post processing layer applies the mechanisms to privatize the results.


Test datasets are found at service/datasets/, queries currently must name tables with db name and table name, for simplicity most schemas(under datasets but .yaml instead of .csv) use dataset_name.dataset_name.


## Setup
For now setup and e2e setup are the same because the dataset service feature does not have a mock. Once we can mock dataset service features for local csvs(inputs for tests) we can move a smaller subset of dependencies here.


## E2e Setup
For the SQL module we need 3 core components: dataset service for reading the data, the ability to run a module, and the burdock library/dependencies.


Steps:
- create a conda environment: conda create -n oss_dp python
- conda activate oss_dp
- git clone https://github.com/privacytoolsproject/burdock.git
- cd burdock
- conda install -c anaconda sqlite
- python -m pip install -e sdk/
- python -m pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
- python -m pip install -r service/requirements.txt
- python service/app.py
- python service/modules/sql-module/run_query.py "example" .3 "SELECT COUNT(A) from example.example"
- pytest tests/



## Adding tests
Parser tests and query examples are added at tests/query. E2e tests through the sql module are found as parameterized execute tests at tests/service/execute/.
