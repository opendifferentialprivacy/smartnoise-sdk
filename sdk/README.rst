The WhiteNoise tools allow researchers and analysts to:

 * Use SQL dialect to ceate differentially private results over tabular data stores
 * Host a service to compose queries from heterogeneous differential privacy modules (including non-SQL) against shared privacy buget	 
 * Perform black-box stochastic testing against differential privacy modules
