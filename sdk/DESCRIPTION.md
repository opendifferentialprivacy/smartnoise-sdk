# SmartNoise: Tools for Differential Privacy

The SmartNoise tools allow researchers and analysts to: 

* Use SQL dialect to create differentially private results over tabular data stores
* Host a service to compose queries from heterogeneous differential privacy modules (including non-SQL) against shared privacy budget
* Perform privacy algorithm stochastic testing against differential privacy modules

The SmartNoise system is currently aimed at scenarios where the researcher is trusted by the data owner.  Future releases will focus on hardened scenarios where the researcher or analyst is untrusted.
